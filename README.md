Google play store app engagement analysis- Our project shed light on the current trends in the Android market, showcasing the dominance of categories that either assist, communicate, or entertain users. The top categories, such as GAME, SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION, and TOOL, dictated the Android landscape, with a focus on quality and user engagement rather than sheer volume of apps.Through robust data analysis and visualization, our project not only provided valuable insights for developers but also contributed to a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics within the Android app market.

Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction- In conclusion, the bike rental company can deploy a Random Forest Regressor-based machine learning model to accurately predict the demand for city bikes for a particular hour, facilitating efficient supply management. Additionally, when anticipating low demand days/seasons, the company can redirect bikes for maintenance.

Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell_Prediction- Machine Learning Models used: Logistic Regression Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XG-Boost, are applied. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV yields improvements. The Random Forest Classifier emerges with the highest F1-score of 87% on the test set, indicating no overfitting

Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows_Clustering- This project effectively examined the Netflix dataset of TV shows and movies using NLP techniques. Through content clustering and the development of a content-based recommender system, the objective was to improve the user experience and reduce subscriber churn for Netflix. The insights and recommendations derived from this project hold the potential to contribute to Netflix's ongoing growth and success in the fiercely competitive streaming entertainment industry.
